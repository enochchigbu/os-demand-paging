1. Build empty page table (PageTable)

2. Read one memory address from trace file

3. Traverse tree to see if vpn -> pfn mapping info exists 
   with findVpn2Pfnmapping()

4a. If mapping info is found (true):
    - PageTable Hit
    - Update or insert page recent access memory for Replacement (WSClock)

4b. If mapping info is not found (false):
    a. Add mapping information for the vpn -> pfn
    b. If WSClock still has free entries, map to next free index
    c. If all entries of WSClock are taken, run page replacement
        - Update mapping of replaced WSClockEntry vpn -> pfn in page table
          to invalid.

5. Print appropriate logging from command line input to console

6. Go back to Step 2, repeat until all addresses have been read
